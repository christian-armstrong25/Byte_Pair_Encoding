Lily stopped and looked at her mom. She was not happy. She wanted to record the fox. She thought her mom was not reliable. She thought her mom did not know about foxes. She thought foxes were nice and friendly.
She waited until her mom was busy talking to another mom. She sneaked back to the bushes. She saw the fox again. It was looking at her with big eyes. She smiled and said hello. She pressed the red button and asked, "What is your name, fox?"

Tom and Lily nodded and said, "Okay, mom. We love you. Bye!" They got in the car with their dad and drove to the beach.
When they got there, they saw that the water was very close to the sand. There was not much room to play. Their dad said, "Let's go for a walk along the shore. Maybe we can find some nice shells or rocks. But hold my hand, okay? The water can be strong and pull you in."
Tom and Lily agreed and held their dad's hand. They walked and looked for treasures. Tom found a shiny rock and Lily found a pink shell. They were happy and proud.

Tom and their dad heard her cry. They ran to her and pulled her out of the water. They hugged her and checked if she was okay. Lily was sorry and ashamed. She said, "I'm sorry, dad. I was silly. I should have listened to you and mom. I should have held your hand."
Their dad said, "It's okay, Lily. I'm glad you're safe. I know you're brave and independent, but sometimes you need to be careful and follow the rules. The water can be dangerous, especially when the tide is high. Do you understand?"
Lily nodded and said, "Yes, dad. I understand. I love you. Can we go home now?"
Their dad said, "Yes, we can go home. But first, let's dry off and have a snack. And don't worry, we'll come back to the beach another day, when the tide is low and the water is calm. How does that sound?"
Tom and Lily smiled and said, "That sounds good, dad. Thank you." They held their dad's hand and walked back to the car. They learned a lesson that day. They learned to respect the water and the tide. And they learned to hold their dad's hand.

But then, his castle collapsed. The blocks fell down. They made a loud noise. They hit Tom. He fell down too. He was hurt and scared. He cried and said, "Help! Help! My castle! My blocks!"
Ben and Lily ran to him. They helped him get up. They gave him some of their blocks. They said, "Tom, are you OK? We are sorry for your castle. But you should not have taken our blocks. You should not have made trouble. You should have been nice and shared. That is what smart people do."
Tom felt ashamed. He realized he was wrong. He said, "I am sorry, Ben and Lily. You are right. I was not smart. I was mean and greedy. Can you forgive me? Can we be friends?"
Ben and Lily nodded. They said, "Yes, we can forgive you. We can be friends. But you have to be nice and share. And you have to attach the blocks well. Then we can all make nice things together."

A wise old man saw what they were doing. He came to them and said, "Why are you so rude and selfish? Don't you know that this is a sacred place? Don't you know that you are hurting the feelings of others? Don't you know that you are wasting the gifts that you have?"
Lila and Ben did not listen to the old man. They ignored him and continued to play with their toys. They thought he was boring and silly. They did not want to learn anything from him.

But the plant heard them and said, "Don't be afraid. I am a friendly plant. I came from far away to visit your garden. I want to be your friend. Please, come closer and talk to me."
Lily and Ben did not trust the plant. They thought it was lying and wanted to hurt them. They said, "No, thank you. We don't want to play with you. We like the ordinary plants. They are nice and pretty. You are not. You are ugly and mean. Go away."
The plant was sad and angry. It said, "How rude and unkind you are. You judge me by how I look, not by how I feel. You don't want to know me or learn from me. You miss a chance to make a new friend. You are the ones who are ugly and mean. I will go away, but I will take something with me."
The plant opened its mouth and swallowed all the flowers and fruits in the garden. Then it lifted its head and flew away. Lily and Ben were shocked and sorry. They realized they had made a mistake.

Later that day, it happened to see the bigger turtle again. It wanted to thank it, so the little one spoke up and said: "Thank you so much for your kind words. You are right - when I believe in myself, I feel strong enough to do everything I want". 
The big turtle smiled. "That's what I like to see" it said. "Believe and you will become as strong as the shell you live in".

Once upon a time there lived a mighty flood. It was so powerful that it spread far and wide, sweeping away everything in its path. 
One day a brave little boy called Bobbie decided to try and fix the mighty flood. He grabbed his shovel and started digging a ditch. His grandma saw him and went over.
"What are you doing, my dear Bobbie?" asked grandma.
"I'm trying to fix the flood," said Bobbie.
Grandma smiled and said, "That's very kind of you, Bobbie. But I'm afraid nothing can fix a mighty flood, not even you. But you can help by clearing debris from it. That way, the flood will be a little less mighty."
Bobbie nodded and threw his little shovel aside. Instead, he ran over to the flood and started clearing the debris away. He worked hard all day until he had cleared the flood enough to make it a little less mighty. 
It was hard work, but Bobbie had learnt a good lesson that day. He realised that no matter how mighty something may seem, we can always do something to make it better -- even if it's just a little.
